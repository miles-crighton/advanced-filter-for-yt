# YouTube Advanced Filter

Live version: <to be added>

## Motive 
The aim of the app was provide fast search queries without navigating through the YT interface.

A feature that isn't included in YT's native UI is search by specific video duration, and so this was a desired feature.

Quick to access saveable search queries was also a big quality of life for recurrent requests.

## Technologies
